        <p><em>Key Takeaways</em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Though a bit incomplete, this was my first exposure to the UX design process!</li>
            <li>Conducted user research and interviews.</li>
            <li>Learned how to create LoFi wireframes and develop HiFi prototypes.</li>
            <li>Looking back, more user research and testing would definitely allow for a better final product; what additional features do users want to be included rather than just being able to share?</li>
            <li>More time is always good too allow for more iteration! We did not get the chance to iterate much here.</li>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Context</h2>
            <p>
                In an Intro to Informatics class, we were tasked to propose any type of information system as a solution to any social inequality of our choosing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Problem Space</h2>
            <p>
                Around this time, a Hollywood adaptation of the Japanese anime "Ghost in the Shell" was announced, casting Scarlett Johansson as the main character (who should be Japanese).
                As Asian Americans this upset us as well as the rest of the Asian American community on social media; thus, we felt compelled to tackle this ongoing issue of Asian misrepresentation in the media. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="problem-space" class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Solution</h2>
            <p>
                "representAZN" is an information resource that is designed to be easily shared and viewed on multiple platforms of social media. 
                Our proposed solution aims to raise awareness of the social inequality as well as spark conversation; as most people often overlook this issue.
                We aim to make this information about Asian American misrepresentation more easily accessible to our users.
            </p>
            <p>Features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interactively displays information</li>
                <li>Provides actor testimonies as well as examples of Asian misrepresentation in recent movies</li>
                <li>History of Yellowface in Hollywood</li>
                <li>The effect of this social inequality on society</li>
                <li>Statistics surrounding Asian Americans and Hollywood</li>
                <li>Links to other information resources</li>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Process</h2>
            <p>
                We started off by interviewing a friend of mine, Louie, who at the time was a recent graduate of the UW and worked as a Fellow for the Washington State Commission of
                Asian Pacific American Affairs (APAA). As someone who fights for Asian American social equality every day, she provided us with some
                <a class="hyperlink" href="azn-interview.pdf">interesting insight</a> on the topic.
            </p>
            <p>
                We then created a user persona that we envisioned would use our product. Based off our decided motivations, goals, and challenges, we concluded that our information system need to be:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easily accessible and sharable on social media</li>
                <li>A sleek, simple layout to allow the user to take in information more effectively</li>
                <li>Interactive and/or entertaining for memorability</li>
            </ul>
            <figure class="text-center">
                <img class="persona" src="img/Persona Layout.png" alt="">
            </figure>
            <p>
                Finally, we created an <a class="hyperlink" href="https://imgur.com/Al8Dii4">annotated wireframe</a> before hitting the ground running with our HiFi protoype.
