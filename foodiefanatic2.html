            <h2 class="mb-3">Context</h2>
            <p>
                In a course focused on User Experience and Information Architecture, we were given a case study of Foodie Fanatic,
                Foodie Fanatic - a new specialty cooking and baking store hoping to provide a strong digital and physical store presence across the nation.
                My team and I were tasked to come up with an information architecture proposal for the Foodie Fanatic site so that users are easily able to identify where a specific type of content can be found, locate it, and interact with the site and other users in an intuitive way.
                At the end of the course, we were to give a business pitch as to why our proposal would be the most effective.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Problem Space</h2>
            <p>Foodie Fanatic's goal is to become the one stop shop for all foodies. 
                Below is a list of what they hope to offer to customers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Products, with the appropriate content and data (e.g. photos, price, description, etc)</li>
                <li>Instructional articles with accompanying photos</li>
                <li>Instructional videos</li>
                <li>Multimedia produced by Foodie Fanatic for public consumption</li>
                <li>Multimedia submitted by customers in an effort to engage with Foodie Fanaticand its other users</li>
                <li>Cooking class and local store demos and other events</li>
                <li>Q and A forum boards</li>
                <li>Online contests</li>
            </ul>    
            <p>
                So, pretty much <em>anything and everything that has to do with food!</em> This overload of information became problematic.
                Based on user feedback of Foodie Fanatic's current site, we identified three main issues which we hope to address in our proposed solution: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users are having a very hard time <em>browsing</em> content.</li>
                <li>Users are frustrated by the <em>quality</em> of the content and their level of detail in particular.</li>
                <li>Content is not related to the products well</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Solution</h2>
            <p>
                For the purpose of the class, our proposed solution does not include any Hi-Fi prototyping or UI Designs. 
                We focused mainly on Taxonomy and Information Architecture to make different pieces of information more clear and accessible to all types of users
                to increase customer satisfaction and increase sales for Foodie Fanatic. We proposed a complete rebrand of the company: Foodie-topia.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Vision Statement:</em> For every foodie to use Foodie-topia as a way for them to connect with other foodies and pursue their own personal goals in exploring and cooking new foods.</li>
                <li><em>Mission:</em> Educate, Connect, and Inspire</li>
                <li>Through Foodie-topia, we will create an <em>improved user experience</em> through <em>product and user research</em>, <em>organized and relevant instructional content</em>, and <em>proper communication of events.</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Process</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Persona Creation:</em> based on the three main issues we identified, we developed three User Personas to identify their <em>information needs</em>.

            <p>
                If I were to continue this project:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I would continue past the wireframes and create a high-fidelity prototype of this website using Sketch and inVision</li>
                <li>More usability testing to refine taxonomy, get a better idea of what is intuitive when navigating the contents of the site</li>
                <li>More user research to develop more personas and/or refine current ones</li>
            </ul>
