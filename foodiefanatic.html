            <h2 class="mb-3">Context</h2>
            <p>
                In a course focused on User Experience and Information Architecture, myself and a team of 3 others were presented a case study of 
                Foodie Fanatic - a new specialty cooking and baking store hoping to provide a strong digital and physical store presence across the nation.
                Foodie Fanatic's goal is to become the one stop shop for all foodies. Below is a list of what they hope to offer to customers:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Products, with the appropriate content and data (e.g. photos, price, description, etc)</li>
                <li>Instructional articles with accompanying photos</li>
                <li>Instructional videos</li>
                <li>Multimedia produced by Foodie Fanatic for public consumption</li>
                <li>Multimedia submitted by customers in an effort to engage with Foodie Fanaticand its other users</li>
                <li>Cooking class and local store demos and other events</li>
                <li>Q and A forum boards</li>
                <li>Online contests</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So pretty much to sum it up: <em>anything and everything that has to do with food.</em></p>
            <p>As a team, we were tasked to come up with an information architecture proposal for the Foodie Fanatic site so that users are easily able to identify where a specific type of content can be found, locate it, and interact with the site and other users in an intuitive way.</p>

        <div id="problem-space" class="container mb-4">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Current Issues</h2>
            <p>From Foodie Fanatic's initial user research, they have recieved the following feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“I always have a hard time browsing for things like blenders!”</li>
                <li>“You have lots of instructional videos and the quality of the ones I have watched are great, but there are so many and they are poorly organized that I usually ignore them.”</li>
                <li>“There are no "details" on this cooking class page - no price, no dates etc. Then I realized it was because it happened yesterday.”</li>
                <li>“Why don’t you have recipies using the food you sell?”</li>
                <li>“After about 10 minutes of searching I usually haven’t found anything. I browse through all of it, and it’s a bunch of crap!”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus, we have identified three main issues that we hope to address in our proposed solution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users are having a hard time browsing content</li>
                <li>They are frustrated by the quality of the content and their level of detail in particular</li>
                <li>Content is not related to the products well</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="design-description" class="container mb-4">
            <h2 class="mb-3">User Personas</h2>
            <p>To fully articulate and understand the needs of potential users of the Foodie Fanatic site, we developed three user personas and identified each of their individual information needs.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3 class="text-center my-3">Olivia - The Stay At Home Mom</h3>

        <div id="final-eval" class="container mb-5">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Content Strategy</h2>
            <p>Identifying our user needs allowed us to easily come up with a content strategy for our proposed site. We planned to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimize browsing, searching, and filtering for easier access to products and content</li>
                <li>Strive to create clear and highly-organized instructional videos and articles for foodies at home</li>
                <li>Provide a platform which serves to connect foodies as a community both physically and digitally</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After iterating on feedback from peers and our professor, we came up with the following Sitemap and Taxonomy diagram to aid us in developing our first wireframes.</p>
