            <h2 class="mb-3">Context</h2>
            <p>In a course focused on Design Thinking, a team of myself and two others were tasked with an interesting challenge - <em>Design for Disaster</em>. Given the following constraints:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What constitutes a disaster?</li>
                <li>What is the scale of this disaster?</li>
                <li>Are we designing preventative measures, rescue technology, or something else?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We decided to revamp the first aid kit; a technology that is used at all scales of disaster.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="problem-space" class="container mb-4">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Problem Space</h2>
            <p>A current problem with first-aid kits is peoples' lack of experience with its contents and procedures,
                as well as the general lack of organization of items contained within them. 
                In addition, it is also currently difficult to located first aid in many buildings on campus - 
                if we take a look at UW's building maps on the walls, there are marked fire extinguishers, but no marked first aid stations.
                First aid often needs to be administered as quickly as possible, so we wanted to make the process faster and easier.
            </p>
            <p>Here are the questions we needed answered to confirm this belief:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>During a disaster or another case of emergency, do people know where they can access a first-aid kit?</li>
                <li>How are the contents of a first-aid kit currently organized, if at all?</li>
                <li>Are first-aid kits difficult to use in disasters (under high levels of stress and panic, with various events occurring in the immediate environment)?</li>
                <li>What type of first-aid kits are most commonly distributed? What is the standard for what items they contain?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In order to control the scope of this experience, narrowed our research to the following design questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How can we assure that non-medically trained individuals understand the use case of every supply piece in a first-aid kit?</li>
                <li>How can we assure that non-medically trained individuals understand how to properly apply every supply piece in a first-aid kit, under a stressed condition?</li>
                <li>How can we make our physical and digital designs simple and easy to use for a user who may be panicking or under high levels of stress?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Design Specifications</h2>
            <p>The design of our enterprise first-aid kit consisted of two parts; a physical cardboard prototype of the kit itself and the digital interface display embedded in the kit. 
                Our physical enterprise kit contained all supplies of a class B first-aid kit required by OSHA. 
                On the inside of its door is an embedded, digital touch screen interface. 
                It has multiple compartments, systematically organizing the supplies to be consistent with the information provided by our digital interface. 
                Each compartment are numbered and grouped by color, allowing users to find items with ease in accordance to the location of each item specified on our interface. 
                The interface itself provided two major categories of information: quick step instructions that explain how to use the products in the context of various first-aid procedures, and disaster safety information and protocol specific to the UW campus.</p>
            <p>Our design was limited by the following requirements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><em>The display must have a long battery life (10+ years).</em> This is because first aid kits are commonly unused for long periods of time (hopefully), therefore any requirement of high touch, such as frequent charging, would be both cumbersome and error-prone.</li>
                <li><em>The interface must not be reliant on internet connectivity.</em> All information should be pre-uploaded to the interface. In the case of a disaster, technological infrastructure is likely to be damaged or unavailable. Thus, the interface must be able to function offline.</li>
                <li><em>The first-aid kit should be designed to withstand major impact and collisions.</em> In the case of disaster, it’s very possible for the kit to fall or sustain impact with debris. Its contents are useless if they are damaged, so the case must be durable.</li>
                <li><em>The information provided by our interface must be concise, yet meaningful.</em> A user operating the digital interface must be able to do so effectively even under duress. We do not want to overwhelm the user by bombarding them with information.</li>
            </ol>

        <div id="final-eval" class="container mb-5">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Final Evaluation</h2>
            <p>For our final design, we decided to use both numbering and color-coding to guide users towards the supplies they need. Each row in our 3-by-3 grid is assigned a color: the top row is green, the middle row is orange, and the bottom row is blue. In addition to color coding, each compartment is numbered, starting at 1, reading left-to-right. When a user selects a set of medical instructions on the digital interface, a supplies list is displayed at the top of the page. Next to each supply listed, a white number with a colored background is displayed — matching the physical interface in our first aid kit. Without the use of colors, a number next to the supply may look like a quantity, which is confusing. Without a number, the user has to look through as many as three compartments to find what they are looking for, which is inefficient. Using both of these identifiers in tandem helps to clearly communicate where the user should look to find the supplies they need.</p>

            <p>There were no specific roles assigned within our team, as it was an overall team effort. However, my specific contributions included utilizing Sketch and inVision to create the interface page mockups, and detailing our process in a final written deliverable of our design specifications document.</p>
